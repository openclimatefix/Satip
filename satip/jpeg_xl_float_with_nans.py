        This __init__ function is a simple hack to make the JpegXl compressor in the currently
        released version of imagecodecs (version 2021.11.20) look like the version in development.
        (We can't simply use the version in development because the imagecodecs author does not
        develop on GitHub. The imagecodecs authors just uses GitHub as one of several mechanisms
        to release imagecodecs.)

                To quote the cjxl man page:
                The preferred way to specify quality. It is specified in multiples of a
                just-noticeable difference. That is, -d 0 is mathematically lossless,
                -d 1 should be visually lossless, and higher distances yield denser and
                denser files with lower and lower fidelity.
            effort: To quote the cjxl man page:
                Controls the amount of effort that goes into producing an “optimal” file in
                terms of quality/size. That is to say, all other parameters being equal,
                a higher effort should yield a file that is at least as dense and possibly

    JPEG-XL does not understand "NaN" values. JPEG-XL only understands floating
    point values in the range [0, 1]. So we must encode NaN values
    as real values in the range [0, 1].

    After lossy JPEG-XL compression, there is slight "ringing" around the edges
    of regions with filled with a constant number. In experiments, when NAN_VALUE = 0.025,
    it appears that the values at the inner edges of a "NaN region" vary in the range
    [0.0227, 0.0280]. But, to be safe, we use a nice wide margin: We don't set
    the value of "NaNs" to be 0.00 because the ringing would cause the values
    to drop below zero, which is illegal for JPEG-XL images.

    After decompression, reconstruct regions of NaNs using "image < NAN_THRESHOLD"
